abstract: The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences
  is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human
  variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses
  and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences
  trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches
  so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent
  on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training.
  Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard,
  if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities
  of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families address these problems and
  show potential to eventually bridge the performance gap. We introduce Tranception,
  a novel transformer architecture leveraging autoregressive predictions and retrieval
  of homologous sequences at inference to achieve state-of-the-art fitness prediction
  performance. Given its markedly higher performance on multiple mutants, robustness
  to shallow alignments and ability to score indels, our approach offers significant
  gain of scope over existing approaches. To enable more rigorous model testing across
  a broader range of protein families, we develop ProteinGym – an extensive set of
  multiplexed assays of variant effects, substantially increasing both the number
  and diversity of assays compared to existing benchmarks.
