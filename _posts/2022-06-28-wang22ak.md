abstract: This paper studies stochastic optimization for a sum of compositional functions,
  where the inner-level function of each summand is coupled with the corresponding
  summation index. We refer to this family of problems as finite-sum coupled compositional
  optimization (FCCO). It has broad applications in machine learning for optimizing
  non-convex or convex compositional measures/objectives such as average precision
  (AP), p-norm push, listwise ranking losses, neighborhood component analysis (NCA),
  deep survival analysis, deep latent variable models, etc., which deserves finer
  analysis. Yet, existing algorithms and analyses are restricted in one or other aspects.
  The contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive convergence analysis
  of a simple stochastic algorithm for both non-convex and convex objectives. Our
  key result is the improved oracle complexity with the parallel speed-up by using
  the moving-average based estimator with mini-batching. Our theoretical analysis
  also exhibits new insights for improving the practical implementation by sampling
  the batches of equal size for the outer and inner levels. Numerical experiments
  on AP maximization, NCA, and p-norm push corroborate some aspects of the theory.
