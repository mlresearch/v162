title: Implicit Bias of Linear Equivariant Networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) are generalizations
  of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which excel in a wide range of technical
  applications by explicitly encoding symmetries, such as rotations and permutations,
  in their architectures. Although the success of G-CNNs is driven by their explicit
  symmetry bias, a recent line of work has proposed that the implicit bias of training
  algorithms on particular architectures is key to understanding generalization for
  overparameterized neural nets. In this context, we show that L-layer full-width
  linear G-CNNs trained via gradient descent for binary classification converge to
  solutions with low-rank Fourier matrix coefficients, regularized by the 2/L-Schatten
  matrix norm. Our work strictly generalizes previous analysis on the implicit bias
  of linear CNNs to linear G-CNNs over all finite groups, including the challenging
  setting of non-commutative groups (such as permutations), as well as band-limited
  G-CNNs over infinite groups. We validate our theorems via experiments on a variety
  of groups, and empirically explore more realistic nonlinear networks, which locally
  capture similar regularization patterns. Finally, we provide intuitive interpretations
  of our Fourier space implicit regularization results in real space via uncertainty
  principles.
