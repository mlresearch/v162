title: 'Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: 'Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to
  train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements
  is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank,
  Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end
  training due to unfavorable efficiency–quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse
  fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight
  matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is
  hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices
  for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly
  used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix
  with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These
  properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and
  dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency
  tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and
  GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by
  2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI
  reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique
  called "reverse sparsification," Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate
  representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality
  drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized
  implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning,
  as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning
  on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.'
