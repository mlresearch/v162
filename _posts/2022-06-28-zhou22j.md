title: Improving Adversarial Robustness via Mutual Information Estimation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are found to be vulnerable to adversarial noise.
  They are typically misled by adversarial samples to make wrong predictions. To alleviate
  this negative effect, in this paper, we investigate the dependence between outputs
  of the target model and input adversarial samples from the perspective of information
  theory, and propose an adversarial defense method. Specifically, we first measure
  the dependence by estimating the mutual information (MI) between outputs and the
  natural patterns of inputs (called natural MI) and MI between outputs and the adversarial
  patterns of inputs (called adversarial MI), respectively. We find that adversarial
  samples usually have larger adversarial MI and smaller natural MI compared with
  those w.r.t. natural samples. Motivated by this observation, we propose to enhance
  the adversarial robustness by maximizing the natural MI and minimizing the adversarial
  MI during the training process. In this way, the target model is expected to pay
  more attention to the natural pattern that contains objective semantics. Empirical
  evaluations demonstrate that our method could effectively improve the adversarial
  accuracy against multiple attacks.
