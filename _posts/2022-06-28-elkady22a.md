title: Discrete Tree Flows via Tree-Structured Permutations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: While normalizing flows for continuous data have been extensively researched,
  flows for discrete data have only recently been explored. These prior models, however,
  suffer from limitations that are distinct from those of continuous flows. Most notably,
  discrete flow-based models cannot be straightforwardly optimized with conventional
  deep learning methods because gradients of discrete functions are undefined or zero.
  Previous works approximate pseudo-gradients of the discrete functions but do not
  solve the problem on a fundamental level. In addition to that, backpropagation can
  be computationally burdensome compared to alternative discrete algorithms such as
  decision tree algorithms. Our approach seeks to reduce computational burden and
  remove the need for pseudo-gradients by developing a discrete flow based on decision
  treesâ€”building upon the success of efficient tree-based methods for classification
  and regression for discrete data. We first define a tree-structured permutation
  (TSP) that compactly encodes a permutation of discrete data where the inverse is
  easy to compute; thus, we can efficiently compute the density value and sample new
  data. We then propose a decision tree algorithm to build TSPs that learns the tree
  structure and permutations at each node via novel criteria. We empirically demonstrate
  the feasibility of our method on multiple datasets.
