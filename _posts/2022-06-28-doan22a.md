title: Bayesian Learning with Information Gain Provably Bounds Risk for a Robust Adversarial
  Defense
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: We present a new algorithm to learn a deep neural network model robust against
  adversarial attacks. Previous algorithms demonstrate an adversarially trained Bayesian
  Neural Network (BNN) provides improved robustness. We recognize the learning approach
  for approximating the multi-modal posterior distribution of an adversarially trained
  Bayesian model can lead to mode collapse; consequently, the model’s achievements
  in robustness and performance are sub-optimal. Instead, we first propose preventing
  mode collapse to better approximate the multi-modal posterior distribution. Second,
  based on the intuition that a robust model should ignore perturbations and only
  consider the informative content of the input, we conceptualize and formulate an
  information gain objective to measure and force the information learned from both
  benign and adversarial training instances to be similar. Importantly. we prove and
  demonstrate that minimizing the information gain objective allows the adversarial
  risk to approach the conventional empirical risk. We believe our efforts provide
  a step towards a basis for a principled method of adversarially training BNNs. Our
  extensive experimental results demonstrate significantly improved robustness up
  to 20% compared with adversarial training and Adv-BNN under PGD attacks with 0.035
  distortion on both CIFAR-10 and STL-10 dataset.
