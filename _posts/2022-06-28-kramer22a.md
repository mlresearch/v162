title: Reconstructing Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Multi-Modal Time Series
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Empirically observed time series in physics, biology, or medicine, are commonly
  generated by some underlying dynamical system (DS) which is the target of scientific
  interest. There is an increasing interest to harvest machine learning methods to
  reconstruct this latent DS in a data-driven, unsupervised way. In many areas of
  science it is common to sample time series observations from many data modalities
  simultaneously, e.g. electrophysiological and behavioral time series in a typical
  neuroscience experiment. However, current machine learning tools for reconstructing
  DSs usually focus on just one data modality. Here we propose a general framework
  for multi-modal data integration for the purpose of nonlinear DS reconstruction
  and the analysis of cross-modal relations. This framework is based on dynamically
  interpretable recurrent neural networks as general approximators of nonlinear DSs,
  coupled to sets of modality-specific decoder models from the class of generalized
  linear models. Both an expectation-maximization and a variational inference algorithm
  for model training are advanced and compared. We show on nonlinear DS benchmarks
  that our algorithms can efficiently compensate for too noisy or missing information
  in one data channel by exploiting other channels, and demonstrate on experimental
  neuroscience data how the algorithm learns to link different data domains to the
  underlying dynamics.
